PREREQUISITES

Scala 2.8 (RC1) / Java 1.6 / SuperCollider 3.3.1+ / ScalaCollider / ScalaOSC / ScalaInterpreterPane

INSTALLATION

The following libraries have to be downloaded and installed into the "libraries" folder:

    - ScalaOSC (grab it from http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC)
    - ScalaCollider (grab it from http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider)
    - ScalaInterpreterPane (grab it from http://github.com/Sciss/ScalaInterpreterPane)

Compile using the included IntelliJ IDEA 9 CE project.

RUNNING

"ScalaColliderSwing.command" should be a double-clickable shell script (on Mac; on Linux you should be able to run it with bash). It will launch the front-end (assuming that $SCALA_HOME was set).
